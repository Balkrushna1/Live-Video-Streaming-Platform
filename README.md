# Live-Video-Streaming-Platform
Web application built in React Js with Redux. Have used JSON server for storing video streaming information and RTMP server for streaming live video. A user can open app and can watch streams which are live and a signed user (with google authentication) can create new streams or can edit his existing streams.
